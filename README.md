# API-testing-mindmap
An API pentesting workflow and cheatsheet mindmap

![API Hacking Workflow sample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c34bb64-18e3-44e5-8041-218de46584ef)

This is a mindmap using the xmind app for a visual walkthrough and checklist for REST API testing.  Xmind is a free app with paid addons but it is completely usable in the free form.
 You can get your copy here. https://xmind.app/
 
 ### This mindmap is a work in progress as I go through the books, research and encounter API's in pentests.  I'll update with more content and revisions as I further my understanding.

 To get the most out of this mindmap it's recommended you download the mindmap file.  Then you can 
 - copy n paste queries and cmds included
 - goto links for tools
 - add your own content
 - edit the mindmap visually to your personal satisfaction
 - rearrange the order of the flow

 #### The mindmap is meant to be followed from top downward.  
 - Starting with Tools and wordlists to get started.
 - Passive recon to discover APIs
   - Google, git and shodan dorks.
   - Wayback machine and other passive sites.
  - Active recon
    - Using tools and wordlists to discover APIs on a target
    - Copy n paste command line commands for tools.
  - Scanning and enumerating found APIs.
    - Copy n paste command line commands for tools.
  - Building your own documentation (when none is available)
    - Using postman or Man in the Middle Web to build documentation.
  - Unauthenticated API testing
  - Authenticated API testing
    - Several classes of testing vulnerabilities with example payloads, tools and more.
    - API token testing.
   

> Hopefully this will help you develop a workflow for testing GraphQL for vulnerabilities.  API's can be overwhelming when there are a lot of endpoints and all the pieces are connected in various ways.  This should help you
> - stay focused
> - work through a checklist
> - keep things visually understandable
> - check things are not missed or overlooked.
